# Test Data Sets

This directory contains a set of subdirectories consisting of a small number of data files that can be uses to test an iReceptor Turnkey node's data loading process. This data should not be used in production deployments of the iReceptor Turnkey repository, and should be used only for local testing of the installation and interface. Once the system is tested, you should re-initialize the database to a new empty database, then load your own data.
