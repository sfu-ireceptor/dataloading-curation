# Overview 
This directory contains test rearrangement data annotated by the igblast annotation tool. This directory consists of an example igblast annotation file (in AIRR TSV format) and an accompanying repertoire metadata file.

A detailed description of using igblast is beyond the scope of this document, for more details please visit the igblast documentation page (https://ncbi.github.io/igblast/)

The example data set consists of two data files. The first file is a repertoire metadata file, as a UTF-8 encoded CSV file. The file consists of a header line, which contains the field names that will be written to the repository, followed by a single metadata line for a single repertoire from the above study. In a typical repertoire metadata file, there would be a single line for each repertoire in the study. The second file is a rearrangement file for this repertoire, as annotated using the igblast annotation tool. The file is a typical annotation output file from igblast in AIRR format.
