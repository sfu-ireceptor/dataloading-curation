# Overview 
This directory contains test rearrangement data annotated by the igblast annotation tool. This directory consists of an example igblast annotation file (in AIRR TSV format), an accompanying repertoire metadata file, and a simple shell script that loads the files into a local iReceptor repository.

A detailed description of using igblast is beyond the scope of this document, for more details please visit the igblast documentation page (https://ncbi.github.io/igblast/)
