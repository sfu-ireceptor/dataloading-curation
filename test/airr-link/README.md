# Overview 
This directory contains test AIRR object linking files that are designed to work with the data in the airr-rearrangement, airr-clone, and airr-cell directories of this github repository. Please refer to these directories for information about the test data itself. 

# Example Data

The example data in this directory assumes that the data in the above directory has been loaded into an iReceptor Turnkey repository. The files contained in this directory associate Rearrangement, Clone, Cell, and Expression data files from the relevant directories above. These files can be used with the iReceptor Turnkey link_rearrangement2clone.sh, link_rearrangement2cell.sh, and link_expression2cell.sh scripts to link the relevant AIRR object IDs in the repository once the data is loaded. 

Please refer to the [iReceptor Turnkey data linking](https://github.com/sfu-ireceptor/turnkey-service-php#resolving-internal-data-linkages) documentation for more information.
