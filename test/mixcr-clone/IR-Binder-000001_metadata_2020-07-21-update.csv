Two consecutive PCR reactions were performed to generate fragments tagged with Illumina-compatible adapters and 7 nucleotide barcodes. All PCRs were performed using Phusion HS II (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.). After electrophoretic separation, amplicons were purified using the NucleoSpin® Gel and PCR Clean-up kit (Macherey-Nagel), quantified on the Qubit platform (QIAGEN) and pooled to a final concentration of 4 nM.

As reference for sequence alignment the default MiXCR library was used for TRB sequences and the IMGT library v3 for IGH. Non-productive reads and sequences with less than 2 read counts were not considered for further analysis. Each unique CDR3 nucleotide sequence was defined as one clone. Data was filtered according to the following algorithm: 1. Export alignments with specific –c function 2. If there are some TRB, IGH, TRA, TRD etc. left, the corresponding clone.txt file was opened and replaced the “wrong” position with the right one from the clone.txt file. 3. If there are any positions left that are wrongly annotated, they were deleted. 4. Deleted all entrys without CDR3 Sequence.
