# iReceptor Repertoire Metadata files

The iReceptor Project maintains a Repertoire Metadata standard file format that it uses in its internal data curation process. Repertoire metadata files are UTF-8 encoded comma delimited text files (CSV files), consisting of a single header line followed by a single line for each repertoire. The header line should consist of the names of the keys that will be stored in the AIRR Data Commons repository. If the intent is to create an AIRR compatible repository, then the header lines should consist of keys that map to AIRR fields as specified in the MiAIRR standard as defined in the [MiAIRR Data Elements](https://docs.airr-community.org/en/stable/miairr/data_elements.html). 

Repertoire metadata files are loaded into a repository using the [iReceptor Data Loading scripts](https://github.com/sfu-ireceptor/turnkey-service-php). The data loading scripts will store all columns contained in the repertoire metadata CSV file that have a header in the first row of the column, and will provide warnings to the user if the file is missing MiAIRR compatible field names. If there is no header line, the data in that column will not be loaded. Please refer to the documentaion on iReceptor Turnkey Data Loading  on how to use these scripts to load repertoire data into a repository.

## Example iReceptor Repertoire Metadata Files

In order to ease the use of iReceptor Repertoire Metadata files, this directory contains an annotated, example Repertoire Metadata Excel file. It consists of a set of rows that describe realistic repertoire samples from an actual studie curated in an iReceptor repository. The first two rows are header rows. The first defines the type of the field (AIRR fields have specific types) and is for added clarity. This row should be removed before loading the data into a repository. The second row defines the field names loaded into the repository. In general, we recommend that you use the AIRR Minimal Standard terms for these columns (these are the default columns provided) but any columns used will be loaded into the repository (custom, non-AIRR columns are loaded).

Documentation on the columns and their uses is provided in the Excel spreadsheet itself. To load the data into an iReceptor Turnkey repository, it is necessary to export the spreadsheet to a UTF-encoded comma separated CSV file. The first row, with the the column types should be removed.
